In a collection of Rhaetic plants, which the Palaeobotani-
cal Department of the Natural History Museum in Stockholm
received some time ago from Hyllinge in Scania, Professor
A. G. NATHORST discovered a specimen, which seems to belong
to a somewhat unusual type of gymnosperms. Prof. NATHORST,
who recognized the interest attached to this specimen, handed
it over to me for a closer examination. As plants of this
type lately have attracted some attention but still are very
imperfectly known, the Swedish specimen may deserve a
short description. It has here been attributed to the newly
established genus Phyllotem'a SALFELD, but this classification
is wholly provisional.

Thick, leaf-bearing shoot with transversely elongated leaf-
scars, arranged spirally round the stem. Leaves sessile, linear,
with 8—12 parallel veins.

The specimen shows two separated stem-fragments, the
relative position of which is such as to render it probable
