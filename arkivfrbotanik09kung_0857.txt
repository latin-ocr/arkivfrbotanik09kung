into branches. This is probably due to the mode of preserva-
tion. In the living plant the veinS, no doubt, traversed the
whole lamina without dividing or anastomosing.

The affinities of the present fossil are very obscure. It
is only in recent time that plants of a similar habit have
been recorded from the Mesozoic rocks. In the Palaeozoic
there existed, in the Cordaitales, a group of plants with Mo-
nocotyledonous-like leaves, spirally arranged on the shoot.
There are some facts which seem to indicate, that the Cor-
daitales persisted also in the Lower Mesozoic. ΟΟΜΡΤΕΒι
described in 1894 some specimens from the Kcuper under
the name C'orclaites keupermnus, and ΙΛΙΟΝῙΕΒ2 has found that
Artisia-like pith-casts occur in the Lias. ΖΕΠᾸᾸΕΗ3 has been
led by these facts to suppose that the Cordaitales existed
also in the Mesozoic. Later on he described, from the Kim-
meridge of catalonia* a stem without leaves but with leaf-
scars of the C'ordaites—type. Prof. NATHORST informs me,
however, that this stem also presents some likeness to that
of l‘Vielanclz'eZla anyzcstifolz'a NATH. ΑΒΒΕΗ5 has recently been
able to state that the fossils, previously described by him
as leaflets of a Cycadophyt, Zamites qramlis 11. sp.,6 were
leaves spirally arranged on a shoot. In the later paper the
affinities of this plant are discussed. It is recognized that
the material gives no satisfactory evidence on that point,
but, with the exclusion of the possibility of Monocotyledo-
nous affinities, there would be equally good grounds for an
attribution to the Corclaitales as to the Coniserales. The name
Yuccites voyesiacus ΞΟΠ. 85 MOUG. is, however, retained tempor-
