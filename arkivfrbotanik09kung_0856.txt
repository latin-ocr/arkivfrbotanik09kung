that they belong together as twigs of the same stem. On
the fragment to the right no leaves remain attached to the
axis, but the impression shows the surface of the stem with
the spirally arranged leaf-scars. The impression of ‘the axis
measures, when the outer parts are preserved, 10—12 mm. in
diameter. In the upper part of the fragment to the right, the
outer layers of the stem have been removed before the de-
position of the fossil. There remains only a sharply defined
centra] axis, 3-4 mm. broad, the carbonized remains of which
show a marked longitudinal striation. It appears most prob-
able, that this centra] part represents the woody part of
the stem. On the impression there are seen some small dot-
like depressions. It seems probable from this specimen that
the outer, less resistant layers of the stem were very thick
as compared with the wood.

The leaf-scars are not very clearly seen. Their spira]
arrangement 011 the shoot is however evident. In the middle
part of the fragment to the right the leaf scars are shown
as they appear on the surface of the carbonized remains of
the stem. The enlarged figures 2-5 are drawn from the
impressions, as seen after the coal has been removed. The
figures give an idea of the variation in shape of the leaf-
scars. These are transversely elongated with a horizontal
diameter of 3-—5 mm. In a few cases so'me small and indis-
tinct dots are seen, which probably represent scars of the
leaf-traces. Their number and mode of arrangement could
not be made out with certainty. They seem, however, to be
at least three, but probably more, and arranged horizontally.

From the shape and size of the leaf-scars, the leaves
appear to have been attached to the stem with a compara-
tively broad base. On the left fragment a number of leaves
are seen still in connection with the stem. They are linear
in shape and somewhat tapering towards the base. Only the
lower parts are preserved. The largest fragment measures
60 mm. in length, without being complete, and is 5——7 mm.
broad in the upper part. The lamina seems to have been
comparatively thick. The veins are parallel, varying in num-
ber, 10—12 in the broadest fragment. They are best seen
on the surface of the carbonaceous remains of the leaf, but
even here they are not very distinct. Each vein can be fol-
lowed only a short distance, before it disappearS, as if split up
