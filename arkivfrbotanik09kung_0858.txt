4 ARKIV Fon BOTANIK. BD 9. N:o 14.

Other fossils, to which these same remarks would apply,
are according to ARBER: Eolirion prioeniqenium SOHENK from
the VVealden, Krannera mirabilis VELENOVSKS? from the Cre-
taceous and perhaps Zamites meqaphyllus(PH1LL1Ps) from the
Oolite.

The Swedish specimen differs from the plants mentioned
above by narrower leaves, which are also more tapering to-
wards the base. In the ocal-bearing beds of Scania there
have been found some detached leaves very similar to those
of the present plant. Some of these leaves have been de-
scribed by Prof. NATHORST¹ under the name Phoenicopsis cfr.
speciosa HEER, and they certainly very much resemble, in
shape and venation, the leaves of that species. It is pos-
sible, however, that at least a good deal of these leaves may
have been borne directly on stems of the same kind as that
described above. Phoenicopsis, as defined by HEER 2, would
embrace only plants with the leaves borne in tufts on short
shoots, which were surrounded by scale-fronds and shed entire
as in C'zelcanowslcia. Unquestionable Phoenicopsis, showing the
leaves attached on short shoots, has not yet been recorded
from Sweden.

SALFELD3 has recently described, from the Jurassic of
Northern Germany, a leaf-bearing stem, under the name
Plzyllotenia Zonqz'solia nov. gen. et sp. This plant reminds, in
the shape and venation of the leaves, of both the Swedish
specimen and the species of Phoenicopsis. The leaves are
said to be attached directly on the stem and probably spir-
ally arranged. SALFELD’s figure gives however no clear idea
of the mode of attachment of the leaves, and 110 leaf-scars
are 50011. The new genus is classed by the author under the
Ginkqoales, mainly, as it seems, from the occurrence of Ginlcqo-
like seeds. The reasons for attributing these seeds to the
leaf-bearing shoot do however not appear, neither in the de-
scription nor in the figures.

In order to avoid the creation of a new provisional
generic name, I have attributed the Swedish specimen to
