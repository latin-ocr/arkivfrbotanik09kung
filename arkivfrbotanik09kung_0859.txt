ΤΗ. G. HALLE, A GYMNOSPERM WITH CORDAITEAN-LIKE LEAVES. 5

Phyllotenia, notwithstanding the obscure nature of that genus
In the shape and attachment of the leaves there seems to
be, at any rate, a greater resemblance to Plcyllotensza lonqi-
solia than to any other fossil that may be considered pos—
sibly allied to the Swedish plant. This differs however in
the closer venation and broader bases of the leaves and in
the distinct, transversely elongated leaf—scars Regarding
these facts a specific identification did not seem advisable.
The accepting of the name Phyllotenia should not be regard-
ed as involving an attribution of the Swedish species to the
Ginkqoales. The possibility of an affinity in this line can
not be denied, but it seems more probable that the Swedish
species is related to the C'oniserales or perhaps rather to the
Cor-daitales. Till better material be procured, it is however
impossible to arrive at even a provisional opinion.
