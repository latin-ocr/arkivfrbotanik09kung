Communieated J 11111 *an 1909 by A. G. NATHORST and G. LAGERHEIM.

The first part of this enumeration‚ containing the four
first classes, viZ. Monandria—Tetrandria, of Linnaeus's system,
was published in 1907 (Arkiv for Botanik 7: 3). I there gave,
by way of introduction, an historical account of the collections
which now constitute the. Linnean herbarium in Stockholm.
In this second part Ι publish a continuation of the list, com-
prising the 5zth class, Pentandria.

As has been mentioned before, several specimens are too
badly preserved or too defective for an exact determinatiom
such specimens will, accordingly, not be mentioned here.
A good many, however, are in an excellent state of preserva-
tion and must be considered as most valuable original speci-
mens, especially those which are labelled by Linnaeus himself.

In this list the plants follow in the order given in the last
works of Linnaeus, especially (Murray’s) Syst. veg. ed. 13
(1774) and Suppl. plant. 1781. — As to the arrangement of
the appended notes, I must refer the reader to part I, p. 17.
For each speeies, then, I first give the name according to the
present conceptions of classifiea‘tion, and as far as possible the
